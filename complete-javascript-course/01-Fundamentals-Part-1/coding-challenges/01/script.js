// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI =  mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
//    versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
//    whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
//    Test data:
//    ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
//    m tall.
//    ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
//    m tall.

// let markBmi = 78 / 1.69 ** 2;
// let johnBmi = 92 / 1.95 ** 2;
let markBmi = 95 / 1.88 ** 2;
let johnBmi = 85 / 1.76 ** 2;
let markHigherBMI = markBmi > johnBmi;

console.log(
  `mark BMI: ${markBmi}, john BMI: ${johnBmi}. Does Mark have a bigger BMI than John? Bool Value: ${markHigherBMI}`,
);
