# Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings

## Arrays VS Sets

1. Arrays

```js
tasks = ['Code', 'Eat', 'Code'];
```

- Use when you need ordered list of values (might contain duplicates)
- Use when you need to manipulate data

2. Sets

```js
tasks = new Set(['Code', 'Eat', 'Code']);
```

- Use when you need to work with unique values
- Use when high-performance is really important
- Use to remove duplicates from arrays

## Objects VS Maps

1. Objects

```js
task = { task: 'Code', date: 'today', repeat: 'true' };
```

- More “traditional” key/value store (“abused” objects)
- Easier to write and access values with . and []
- Use when you need to include functions (methods)
- Use when working with JSON (can convert to map)

2. Maps

```js
task = new Map([
  ['task', 'Code'],
  ['date', 'today'],
  [false, 'Start Coding!'],
]);
```

- Better performance
- Keys can have any data type
- Easy to iterate
- Easy to compute size
- Use when you simply need to map key to values
- Use when you need keys that are not strings
