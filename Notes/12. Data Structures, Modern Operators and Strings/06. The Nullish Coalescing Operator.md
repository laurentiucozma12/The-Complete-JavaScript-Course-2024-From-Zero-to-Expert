# The Nullish Coalescing Operator ??

- The Nullish Coalescing Operator solves our problem, because it works with the concept of nullish values (instead of falsy values)

```js
restaurant.numGuests = 0;
const guests = restaurant.numGuests || 10;
console.log(guests); // 10 - We want to get 0 not 10, the solution is The Nullish Coalescing Operator

// The Nullish Coalescing Operator
// Nullish: null and undefined (NOT 0 or '')
const guestCorrect = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10;
console.log(guestCorrect); // 0
```
