# Logical Assignment Operators

- ||= - OR Assignment operator
- ??= - The Nullish Assignment Operator
- &&= - AND Assignment Operator

1. This is how to write the **OR Assignment operator**:

```js
const rest1 = { name: 'Capri', numGuests: 20 };
const rest2 = { name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi' };

// OR assignment operator
// rest1.numGuests = rest1.numGuests || 10;
// rest2.numGuests = rest2.numGuests || 10;

// New of of writing it:
rest1.numGuests ||= 10;
rest2.numGuests ||= 10;

console.log(rest1); // {name: 'Capri', numGuests: 10}
console.log(rest2); // {name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi', numGuests: 10}
```

2. The problem we have it:

```js
// The only problem is when numGuests is 0
// It is the same problem as before at "Short Circuiting (AND and OR)
const rest1 = { name: 'Capri', numGuests: 0 }; // Here we wrote 0 instead of 10
const rest2 = { name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi' };

rest1.numGuests ||= 10;
rest2.numGuests ||= 10;

console.log(rest1); // {name: 'Capri', numGuests: 10} // Here we want to get 0 NOT 10
console.log(rest2); // {name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi', numGuests: 10}
```

3. **The Nullish Assignment Operator** is the Solution we need in this case:

```js
const rest1 = { name: 'Capri', numGuests: 0 };
const rest2 = { name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi' };

rest1.numGuests ??= 10;
rest2.numGuests ??= 10;

console.log(rest1); // {name: 'Capri', numGuests: 0}
console.log(rest2); // {name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi',  numGuests: 10}
```

4. **AND Assignment Operator**

```js
const rest1 = { name: 'Capri', numGuests: 0 };
const rest2 = { name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi' };

rest1.numGuests ??= 10;
rest2.numGuests ??= 10;

// rest1.owner = rest1.owner && '<ANONYMOUS>';
// rest2.owner = rest2.owner && '<ANONYMOUS>';
rest1.owner &&= '<ANONYMOUS>'; // This is Falsy, since there is no owner, nothing happens
rest2.owner &&= '<ANONYMOUS>'; // This is Truthy, this is why Giovanni was replaced by <ANONYMOUS>

console.log(rest1); // {name: 'Capri', numGuests: 0, owner: undefined}
console.log(rest2); // {name: 'La Piazza', owner: '<ANONYMOUS>',  numGuests: 10}
```

5. The logical solution would be to use again **The Nullish Assignment Operator** in this case:

```js
const rest1 = { name: 'Capri', numGuests: 0 };
const rest2 = { name: 'La Piazza', owner: 'Giovanni Rossi' };

rest1.numGuests ??= 10;
rest2.numGuests ??= 10;

// rest1.owner = rest1.owner && '<ANONYMOUS>';
// rest2.owner = rest2.owner && '<ANONYMOUS>';
rest1.owner ??= '<ANONYMOUS>'; // This is Truthy, since there is no owner, <ANONYMOUS> gets added
rest2.owner ??= '<ANONYMOUS>'; // This is Falsy, this is why Giovanni remains the owner
```
