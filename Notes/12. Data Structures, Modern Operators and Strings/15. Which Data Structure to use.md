# Which Data Structure to use

Sources of Data:

- From the program itself: Data written directly in the source code (e.g. status message)
- From the UI: Data input from the user or data written in DOM (e.g. tasks in todo app)
- From external sources: Data fetched for example from web API (e.g. recipe objects)

How to choose:

- Do we just need a simple list of values? If yes, then use an Array or Set
- If we need key value pairs, then we need an Object or a Map

Arrays VS. Sets and Objects VS. Maps
